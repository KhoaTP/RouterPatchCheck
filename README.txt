File to run on CMD: 
RouterPatchCheck.java

How to run: 
Ensure you are in the current directory of the file, then input the line "java RouterPatchCheck (file.csv)". *notice* this program requires a user input of a CSV file to successfully run.

Assumptions:
- I assumed that all .csv files will have the column formatt. For example, the positioning of "IP Address" was the second column and "Notes" was the fifth column.
